# Piano Roll Component

This directory contains the core piano-roll visualization component for Harmonia.

The piano roll will:
- Display at least 2 octaves of notes
- Highlight chord tones, scale tones, and key signature notes
- Support interactive note selection
- Accept chord and scale objects to automatically highlight notes
- Serve as the primary visualization tool for music theory concepts

The component will be built using React with either Canvas or SVG for rendering.
