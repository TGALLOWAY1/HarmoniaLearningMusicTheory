# Piano Roll Component

This directory contains the core piano-roll visualization component for Harmonia.

The piano roll:
- Displays a single canonical octave (default: C3-B3, MIDI 48-59)
- Highlights chord tones, scale tones, and key signature notes
- Uses a horizontal keyboard layout with white and black keys
- Accepts highlight layers to display multiple sets of notes simultaneously
- Maps all notes to a single octave to avoid duplicates
- Serves as the primary visualization tool for music theory concepts

The component is built using React with TailwindCSS for styling.
